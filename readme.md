> # Deprecation notice
> [Azure DevOps Server is deprecating the old work item APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/wit-client-om-deprecation?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5001511&view=azure-devops). They are likely not going to be removed any time soon, but we can't keep supporting this plugin version forever. 
>
> [Our recomendation is to migrate to aggregator-cli which can now be hosted on Azure Functions or in Docker](https://github.com/tfsaggregator/aggregator-cli).
> 
> We won't do any major investment in this Plugin version and our bandwidth for support is limited.

This server side plugin, for TFS 2013 update 2 up to TFS 2018.3 and Azure DevOps Server 2019, 2020 and 2022, enables running custom script when Work Items change,
allowing dynamic calculation of field values in TFS and more. (For example: Dev work + Test Work = Total Work).

 - Update the state of a Bug, PBI (or any parent) to "In Progress" when a child gets moved to "In Progress"
 - Update the state of a Bug, PBI (or any parent) to "Done" when all children get moved to "Done" or "Removed"
 - Update the "Work Remaining" on a Bug, PBI, etc with the sum of all the Task's "Work Remaining".
 - Update the "Work Remaining" on a Sprint with the sum of all the "Work Remaining" of its grandchildren (i.e. tasks of the PBIs and Bugs in the Sprint).
 - Sum up totals on a single work item (i.e. Dev Estimate + Test Estimate = Total Estimate)
 - Create new work items
 - Create new work item links
